	<div class="timeline-year 1890">
		<h1>1890</h1>
		<p> Edward Green opens for business in North Hampton, England. Laces were all the rage along with Spats, a formal gaitor that sits above the shoe.</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="timeline-year 1930">
		<h1>1930</h1>
		<p> We become one of the largest manufacturers of officers’ boots for the British Army. In formal wear two-tone Brogues were at their peak due to the influence of tap dancing movie stars like Fred Astaire.</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="timeline-year 1982">
		<h1>1982</h1>
		<p>  Edward Green is sold to John Hlustik, an expert at finishing who is credited with making brown shoes acceptable to British men. Men’s styles ran conservative with the Oxford, Brogue, and Loafer at the top of business fashion.</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="timeline-year 2000">
		<h1>2000</h1>
		<p>After the unexpected death of John Hlustik, his partner Hilary Freeman took over the company. He vowed to continue Edward Green’s level of craftsmanship. While business has grown to be more casual, men still appreciate a quality shoe. Square toes fit the casual yet formal style of the time.</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="timeline-year Today">
		<h1>Today</h1>
		<p>Edward Green continues our elevated level of craftsmanship. We produce no more than 325 shoes a week. Our shoes are sold at shops from Tokyo to New York City to our home in England.</p>
